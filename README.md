TASK 2 -AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION

## Description:
This project focuses on generating a professional PDF weather report using Python. I worked on reading a CSV file containing weather data, analyzing the information, and creating a summarized PDF report. The main objective was to understand how to process structured data and present it in a readable, visual format.

I started by importing the required Python libraries: pandas for data analysis and fpdf for PDF generation. Using pandas, I read the CSV file and calculated key metrics like average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. I also counted the frequency of different weather types such as Clear, Clouds, and Rain.

Next, I designed a PDF layout using fpdf. I added a title, summarized statistics, and a weather type frequency section. Each part of the report was formatted with proper fonts and spacing to ensure clarity and readability.

This task taught me how to transform raw tabular data into a polished report. I also learned about automation in Python, as the PDF can be generated anytime simply by providing a CSV file.

## Features
